These are notes for running MAPLE_v3 in docker. Rough draft will be added to readme later.

Building the image. If you are trying to build the image on an Apple m1, m2 chip, you will
need to use the following command:

docker build --platform linux/amd64  -t maplev3:latest .

This command mounts the data directory in when running the image:

docker run -t -i -v /Users/helium/Desktop/MAPLE/data:/home/data maplev3:latest
