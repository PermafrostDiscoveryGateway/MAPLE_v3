ML enthusiasts can experiment with alternatives to the current best model (Mask-RCNN) for Ice-wedge Polygons (IWPs) to get exposed to the ML training pipeline for remote sensing. Existing training data for IWPs can be used for this exercise. Can start with a simple Mask RCNN model. This is a document to get you started.
